## Contributing
This is an incomplete list and we welcome contributions! Feel free to use email, Github issues, or pull requests to suggest additional tools, news, movements, and resources to include.

Some general goals for this page:

- Let links mostly speak for themselves. To start, we've include a brief quote from each link that tries to give a high-level summary.
- For each link, we also include a very brief summary and highlight unique strengths
  - Was the tool designed with explicit concessions in mind? In other words, are users of the tool already actively working to *exert leverage*?
- Emphasize tools that are particularly easy to use. We're eager for people to share their experiences using these tools..
