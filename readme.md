# Data Leverage Roundup
Powerful data-dependent technologies rely on the public (including you and everyone you know) to fuel them with data. This means collective action that involves withholding, deleting, manipulating, and/or transfering data can help the public exert [data leverage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09995) against technology companies, potentially pushing for meaningful change (which could range from taking privacy more seriously to [making serious changes to the data economy](https://www.datadividends.org/)).

For more info, see the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09995) or this [recent](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/05/1020376/resist-big-tech-surveillance-data/) [coverage](https://fortune.com/2021/02/23/your-data-is-a-weapon-that-can-help-change-corporate-behavior/) of data leverage.


This document includes a roundup of tools, news, social movements, civic initiatives, and resources related to data deverage.



This is by no means complete and we welcome contributions! See "Contributing" at the bottom of this document.

## Contributing
This is an incomplete list and we welcome contributions! Feel free to use email, Github issues, or pull requests to suggest additional tools, news, movements, and resources to include.

Some general goals for this page:

- Let links mostly speak for themselves. To start, we've include a brief quote from each link that tries to give a high-level summary.
- For each link, we also include a very brief summary and highlight unique strengths
  - Was the tool designed with explicit concessions in mind? In other words, are users of the tool already actively working to *exert leverage*?
  - Does the tool work well for collective action?
  - etc.
- Emphasize tools that are particularly easy to use. We're eager for people to share their experiences using these tools.

In addition to content contributions, we're also in interested in feedback about what kinds of structured information would be useful. In particular, we hope to eventually create structured data (for instance, a CSV file) that describes data leverage tools. What attributes (i.e. columns) would you like to see?
